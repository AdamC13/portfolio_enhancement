            <h2>Background</h2>
            <h5>
                I grew up and went to school in a small town in New York State. In school my favorite subjects were math and science!  
                I also played soccer, basketball, and track and field! While going to school I heard of a local robotics team for FIRST Robotics. 
                I later decided to join that team and that was where my love for prgramming began! Competing in robotics, sports, as well as competitive games was always a good pass time for me.
                While in school I also volunteered at a WW2 warplane museum! At the museum I had hands on experience with plane engines and mechanics.

                For my education I have an advanced regents diploma from highschool. For my college education, I started at Clarkson University going for engineering in aerospace. 
                After deciding it wasn't what i wanted to do I took a break from college. That is when I joined Coding Temple to pursue my dreams of becoming a software engineer!
